                <p>
                    I am a control system programming working in the AV industry. My main programming languages are C#,
                    Simpl Windows, and Vision Tools Pro E. I am looking to change my career path by attending a coding
                    boot to become a Fullstack Web Developer. My dream job is a Senior Programmer overseeing an entire
                    programming department. I am very proud of getting my Crestron Master - Silver level.

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2013 with a bachelors in Computer Engineering
                    and a
                    minor in Computer Science. My focus was in networking and network security. After realizing that
                    network security is not as exciting as I had imagined I switched my job search to looking for a job
                    in programming
