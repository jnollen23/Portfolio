                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a control system programming working in the AV industry. My main programming languages are C#,
                    Simpl Windows, and Vision Tools Pro E. I am looking to change my career path by attending a coding
                    boot to become a Fullstack Web Developer. My dream job is a Senior Programmer overseeing an entire
                    programming department. I am very proud of getting my Crestron Master - Silver level.

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2013 with a bachelors in Computer Engineering
                    and a
                    minor in Computer Science. My focus was in networking and network security. After realizing that
                    network security is not as exciting as I had imagined I switched my job search to looking for a job
                    in programming

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
                I started out of college doing control system programming for a large Audio Visual company. They where looking to integrate modern programming practices into an progromatically lagging industry. After getting my Crestron Master certification and lacking any sort of career trajectory I moved to the largest AV company where I saw an actual career path. Not long after I got my Crestron Master - Silver level certification. I got an offer to move to another company to lead their programming department, my dream job, and took it. Shortly after Covid-19 hit and the company struggled trying to make sales and eventually started letting 90% of the company go over the next year. I was caught at the tail end of the layoffs leaving just the sales staff and some design engineers left. After landing a new job the effects of covid was not just effecting new project opportunities but also causing supply chain problems. This left me without a job for the second time and caused me to start pursing a career outside the AV field. I attended a coding bootcamp to brush up on programming changes of the past 8 years and pick up some new skills to help me enter a new part of my career.
